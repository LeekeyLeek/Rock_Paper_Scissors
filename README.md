These are two Rock, Paper, Scissors games. Project for an online course I'm taking.

ORIGINAL VERSION:
Open "rpsOriginal.html" and type game() in the console. A winner will be declared after 5 rounds.

UPDATED VERSION:
To run the updated version, open rps.html and click the buttons displayed. First player to 5 points will win the game.
